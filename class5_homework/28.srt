00:00:08,474 --> 00:00:14,150
In this episode of the basic tutorial series I will go through the Touch sensor.

2
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:18,545
By the end of this tutorial you will know how does the Touch sensor works.

3
00:00:18,545 --> 00:00:24,900
How to program it, how to attach it to the robot and last but not least how you can use it.

4
00:00:28,815 --> 00:00:36,138
So let's begin with looking at the programming possibilities of the Touch sensor.

5
00:00:36,138 --> 00:00:43,742
First I have the yellow block then I have the orange block.

6
00:00:43,742 --> 00:00:49,923
And of course we can you the Touch sensor as condition of the loop.

7
00:00:51,702 --> 00:00:54,750
And of the switch block.

8
00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:00,369
In all four cases I have the same settings.

9
00:01:00,369 --> 00:01:04,459
First we have to chose on which port the sensor is connected.

10
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:08,551
And then we have to chose from the three actions.

11
00:01:08,551 --> 00:01:12,622
Pressed, Released and Bumped.

12
00:01:12,622 --> 00:01:20,299
Now let's take a look at a program which will help us to understand the differences between the three states of

13
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:22,279
the Touch sensor.

14
00:01:23,639 --> 00:01:26,460
So let's go to the view menu.

15
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:33,948
There we chose the Touch sensor and I have connected my Touch sensor on port 1 so I chose port 1.

16
00:01:33,948 --> 00:01:37,449
As you can see the screen is shown 0.

17
00:01:37,449 --> 00:01:41,604
If I pres the touch sensor it will become 1.

18
00:01:41,604 --> 00:01:47,999
So the touch sensor has only two states Pressed and Released or 1 and 0.

19
00:01:49,419 --> 00:01:53,858
But in the setting we have three states Pressed, Released and Bumped.

20
00:01:55,108 --> 00:01:58,626
So how do we get three states?

21
00:01:58,626 --> 00:02:03,600
If we take a look at the orange block of the Touch sensor.

22
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:16,294
What happens actually is that if we take the Pressed option the robot will wait until the touch sensor is Pressed.

23
00:02:16,294 --> 00:02:22,475
If we take the Released option the robot will wait until the Touch sensor is Released.

24
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:27,544
Which means that at the beginning the Touch sensor must be Pressed.

25
00:02:28,804 --> 00:02:40,502
And if we go to the Bumped option. We have the robot waiting for the Touch sensor.

26
00:02:40,502 --> 00:02:43,777
to be Pressed and afterwards Released.

27
00:02:43,777 --> 00:02:51,388
So actually if in the beginning I have the Touch sensor Pressed then the robot will wait to be Released.

28
00:02:51,388 --> 00:02:53,970
Then Pressed and Released again.

29
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,432
We got familiar with the basic settings of the Touch sensor.

30
00:02:58,102 --> 00:03:01,248
Now let's see how does the touch sensor work.

31
00:03:02,908 --> 00:03:11,623
Let's say I have a battery .
Ð¢his was an ugly one.

32
00:03:11,623 --> 00:03:13,119
So I have a battery.

33
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:24,461
And we take a paper clip which will connect the + and the - sides of the battery.

34
00:03:25,321 --> 00:03:27,865
What will happen with the paper clip?

35
00:03:27,865 --> 00:03:35,259
Well it will get hotter, that is because electricity will flow through the paper clip.

36
00:03:35,259 --> 00:03:39,320
But now let's break the paperclip in two pieces.

37
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,531
Here for instance.

38
00:03:44,597 --> 00:03:52,193
Now electricity won't flow anymore through the paper clip and the paper clip will get cooler.

39
00:03:53,682 --> 00:04:00,009
But if we have another paper clip and connect the two pieces with it.

40
00:04:03,999 --> 00:04:07,111
The paper clip will get hotter again.

41
00:04:07,111 --> 00:04:12,701
So we can make a switch that can connect and disconnect the two pieces.

42
00:04:14,201 --> 00:04:17,547
On similar basis works the Touch sensor.

43
00:04:17,547 --> 00:04:29,771
There is a plate connected to the orange button which when the button is pressed closes the circuit and electricity flows.

44
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:36,733
In that way the brick understands that the touch sensor is Pressed.

45
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:43,485
If we Release the orange button of the Touch sensor a spring pushes back the sensor

46
00:04:43,485 --> 00:04:50,072
and the plate disconnects the circuit and electricity does not flow anymore.

47
00:04:51,242 --> 00:04:57,751
So basically this is the principle on which works the Touch sensor.

48
00:04:58,181 --> 00:05:03,320
Now let's see several programs to see how we can use the Touch sensor.

49
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,579
So let's begin with the simplest program possible.

50
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:11,820
I will make my robot stop when it hits a wall.

51
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:21,857
First I take a move block which will move unlimited until the Touch sensor is Pressed.

52
00:05:21,857 --> 00:05:30,946
I cannot chose Released or Bumped because the sensor of the robot will be Released from the beginning.

53
00:05:30,946 --> 00:05:38,979
And with Bumped the problem is that the robot waits for the Touch sensor to be Pressed and then Released.

54
00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:45,384
And when the robot hits the wall the Touch sensor will be only Pressed.

55
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:52,779
So after the Touch sensor is Pressed I take another Move block and make my robot to stop.

56
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:58,643
So let's download and see how it works.

57
00:05:58,643 --> 00:06:04,914
So I use the five minute bot which can be found in episode 0.

58
00:06:04,914 --> 00:06:08,164
And I have attache a Touch sensor to it.

59
00:06:09,554 --> 00:06:16,826
The Touch sensor is on port 1 and the motors are on port B and C.

60
00:06:17,826 --> 00:06:20,930
So let's run the program.

61
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:25,599
And imagine that my hand is a wall.

62
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:29,024
And I start the program.

63
00:06:29,454 --> 00:06:30,890
And the robot stops.

64
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,949
Now let's take our program one step further.

65
00:06:35,619 --> 00:06:47,320
I want the robot to start when the Touch sensor is Pressed and afterwards stop when the Touch sensor is Pressed.

66
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:55,736
So the only difference I should make is to put a Touch sensor in the beginning.

67
00:06:56,496 --> 00:07:01,109
With the same option and download our program.

68
00:07:01,109 --> 00:07:03,899
So let's run the program.

69
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:09,757
I started and the robot isn't moving I Press the Touch sensor.

70
00:07:10,467 --> 00:07:17,961
And unfortunately the robot does not start, but the program finished.

71
00:07:19,751 --> 00:07:30,108
What actually happened is that my touch of the Touch sensor has been detected twice.

72
00:07:30,108 --> 00:07:36,244
Because the microcontroller inside the Brick is way faster than my hand.

73
00:07:37,334 --> 00:07:39,140
How I can fix this?

74
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:44,944
Well it is simply by choosing Bumped option on the first Touch sensor.

75
00:07:45,554 --> 00:07:49,490
Now the robot will wait until I Release my hand.

76
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:55,820
And afterwards it will start moving until the Touch sensor is pressed.

77
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,292
Let's see how does the program work this time.

78
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:03,133
So now the program should work.

79
00:08:03,133 --> 00:08:08,936
I started it and the robot is waiting the Touch sensor to be Bumped.

80
00:08:08,936 --> 00:08:16,496
If I Press the Touch sensor the robot won't start moving until it is Released.

81
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:24,398
So when I Release it, it will start and then stop when the Touch sensor is Pressed.

82
00:08:24,398 --> 00:08:27,633
This was the tutorial about the Touch sensor .

83
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:33,611
In the next tutorial from the series I will show you more about the Sound sensor.

84
00:08:33,611 --> 00:18:38,124
