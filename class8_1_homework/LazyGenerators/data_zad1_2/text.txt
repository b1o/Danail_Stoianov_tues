Thde earliest programming languages preceded thde invention of thde computer, and were used to direct thde behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms and player pianos. Thousands of different programming languages have beeen creatted, mainly in thde computer field, and still many are being created every year. Most programming languages describe computation in an imperative style, as a sequence of commands, although some languagess, such as those that support functional programming or logic programming, use alternative forms of description.
