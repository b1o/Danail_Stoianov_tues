1
00:00:07,655 --> 00:00:14,783
As a result of this video we will develop a new block that's called DistanceMove,

2
00:00:14,783 --> 00:00:19,609
where we can specify the distance in milimeters,

3
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:24,982
that we would like our robot to move for example 200 milimeters and the power.

4
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:31,665
And our robot will move exactly 200 milimeters.

5
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,312
You can of course find this program in the material section,

6
00:00:37,312 --> 00:00:41,211
where you can directly download it and use it in your robots.

7
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:52,796
First I need a new move block and I will configure it to use rotations

8
00:00:52,796 --> 00:00:55,435
the number of rotations we want

9
00:00:55,435 --> 00:01:00,351
and the motors are connected on ports A and B.

10
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:04,431
Let's check how it works.

11
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:16,307
Next we should check the radius of the tires, that this robot use

12
00:01:16,307 --> 00:01:21,272
and as you can see the radius is 28 mm so we will use this value.

13
00:01:22,964 --> 00:01:29,670
In our program what we would like to achieve is to somehow specify the distance,

14
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,991
that we would like to move in mm, for example 200.

15
00:01:33,991 --> 00:01:37,579
Then we will do a small mathematical calculation

16
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:40,920
where we will divide this number 200

17
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,615
to the number of milimeters in the circumference of the tire.

18
00:01:46,615 --> 00:01:54,453
So its 176 and we will use the result of this mathematical block to pass to the

19
00:01:54,453 --> 00:01:59,052
move block and it goes like this.

20
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:04,846
We add this variable where we write the numerical value of 200

21
00:02:04,846 --> 00:02:11,627
then we take another variable block, where we read the value of the distance,

22
00:02:11,627 --> 00:02:22,132
so we should select read and then we pass this value of 200 to the mathematical block.

23
00:02:22,132 --> 00:02:32,505
We choose the operation divide so we divide the number of 200 to 176, which will give us the number of rotation,

24
00:02:32,505 --> 00:02:39,103
that this robot should do in order to move 200 mm forward.

25
00:02:39,103 --> 00:02:41,924
Than we take the result of the operation,

26
00:02:41,924 --> 00:02:43,641
right here

27
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:47,866
and we pass the result to the move block.

28
00:02:47,866 --> 00:02:50,977
Okay, let's see how it works.

29
00:02:55,997 --> 00:03:03,044
Îur next step is to move this whole logic in a new block that will be called DistanceMove,

30
00:03:03,044 --> 00:03:07,426
where we can specify the distance and the power of the motors

31
00:03:07,426 --> 00:03:09,851
and we will see the whole robot

32
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:12,482
move the specified distance.

33
00:03:12,482 --> 00:03:17,149
We select all the blocks,

34
00:03:17,149 --> 00:03:23,408
we open tools, then myBlock builder

35
00:03:23,408 --> 00:03:30,407
we would like to call this new MyBlock DistanceMove

36
00:03:30,407 --> 00:03:34,199
and we will choose an icon for this DistanceMove

37
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:39,206
for example this one and we would like to have two parameters for this block

38
00:03:39,206 --> 00:03:45,502
the first parameter is called Distance in mm

39
00:03:45,502 --> 00:03:50,950
and it will be a number with default value of 0.

40
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:54,771
It will have an icon for example, this one.

41
00:03:54,771 --> 00:03:59,543
The secon parameter is the power of the motors

42
00:03:59,543 --> 00:04:03,286
we have the second parameter, called power.

43
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:10,472
It's again number with default value of 75

44
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:13,674
and let's choose an icon for power.

45
00:04:13,674 --> 00:04:18,529
The icon for power is for example this one.

46
00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:22,847
Okay and we are finished.

47
00:04:22,927 --> 00:04:30,858
Now we have our distancemove block, where we will remove this variable distance

48
00:04:30,858 --> 00:04:33,854
and these are our input parameters for the block.

49
00:04:33,854 --> 00:04:37,350
The first input parameter is the number

50
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:41,449
of milimeters we would like to move,

51
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:44,726
we will pass this to the mathematical block.

52
00:04:44,726 --> 00:04:48,890
The second parameter is the power of the motors,

53
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:53,858
we will pass this to both motors

54
00:04:53,858 --> 00:05:00,297
and we will add this program right here.

55
00:05:00,297 --> 00:05:04,239
As a result we have new block it is a myblock

56
00:05:04,239 --> 00:05:06,193
it receives two parameters

57
00:05:06,203 --> 00:05:08,780
the distance in milimeters and the power

58
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:12,361
and we can use this distancemove block in our program.

59
00:05:12,361 --> 00:05:17,545
For example I will move this here just to show you,

60
00:05:17,545 --> 00:05:21,556
it is located right here in myblocks,

61
00:05:21,556 --> 00:05:23,137
I'll delete it.

62
00:05:23,137 --> 00:05:25,275
I will take new distancemove

63
00:05:25,275 --> 00:05:32,368
and I would like to see my robot move for example a 150 milimeters

64
00:05:32,368 --> 00:05:34,848
with the power of 75.

65
00:05:34,848 --> 00:05:37,495
Let's download and run it

66
00:05:44,495 --> 00:05:46,657
Let's do a number of tests here,

67
00:05:46,657 --> 00:05:48,424
as we have the distancemove,

68
00:05:48,424 --> 00:05:52,044
we will move forward for a 150 milimiters

69
00:05:52,044 --> 00:05:59,707
and then a new block to move backward with the power of -75

70
00:05:59,707 --> 00:06:02,402
for a 100 milimeters

71
00:06:02,402 --> 00:06:05,556
and then we will again move forward

72
00:06:08,366 --> 00:06:11,112
for 50 milimeters.

73
00:06:11,722 --> 00:06:13,812
Let's see how this program works.
